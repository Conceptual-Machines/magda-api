# Premium Features Strategy

## Premium Feature Criteria

When deciding which features should be premium, consider:

1. **Sophistication** - Advanced features requiring deep domain knowledge
2. **Value Proposition** - Features that save significant time/money
3. **Resource Intensity** - Features that require more compute/API calls
4. **Market Differentiation** - Features that make MAGDA competitive
5. **Professional Use** - Features primarily used by professional producers

## Recommended Premium Tiers

### Free Tier (Core Functionality)
These should remain free to ensure basic usability and user adoption:

1. **DAW Agent** ✅ **FREE**
   - **Rationale**: Core functionality - users must be able to control REAPER
   - **Scope**: Basic actions (create track, add clip, simple FX placement)
   - **Limitations**: Can limit to basic actions only, advanced features premium

2. **Plugin Agent (Basic)** ✅ **FREE**
   - **Rationale**: Essential for basic workflow
   - **Scope**: Plugin scanning, basic deduplication
   - **Limitations**: Simple alias generation only

3. **Basic Automation** ✅ **FREE**

- "Advanced automation and sound design"
- "For serious producers"

### Professional Tier Positioning
- "Studio-grade mixing and mastering"
- "Professional workflow tools"
- "Reference track analysis"
- "For professional producers and studios"

## Implementation Considerations

### Agent-Level Gating
```go
type AgentAccessLevel string

const (
    AccessFree         AgentAccessLevel = "free"
    AccessProducer     AgentAccessLevel = "producer"
    AccessProfessional AgentAccessLevel = "professional"
)

func (a *Agent) CheckAccess(userTier string) bool {
    requiredTier := a.RequiredTier
    tierLevels := map[string]int{
        "free":         0,
        "producer":     1,
        "professional": 2,
    }
    return tierLevels[userTier] >= tierLevels[requiredTier]
}
```

### Feature-Level Gating
- Basic features available in free tier
- Advanced features require premium
- Example: Free automation = linear only, Premium = all curve types

### Graceful Degradation
- Premium features show "Upgrade to unlock" messages
- Suggest alternatives when premium feature requested
- Maintain good UX even when features are gated
