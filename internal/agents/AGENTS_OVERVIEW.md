### 5. **Mix/Analysis Agent** 🎚️ (Unified)
**Purpose**: DSP analysis + mixing/mastering recommendations
**Knows**: Audio analysis, frequency spectrum, dynamics, mixing/mastering techniques, FX chains
**Generates**: Analysis insights and mixing/mastering recommendations

**Workflow:**
1. **Bounce** track(s) or master bus to audio
2. **DSP Analysis** using JSFX inside REAPER (frequency, loudness, dynamics, stereo)
3. **Agent Analysis** - LLM analyzes DSP data and provides recommendations
4. **Review & Accept** - User reviews recommendations with Accept/Reject/Modify workflow
5. **Apply Changes** - Accepted recommendations generate REAPER actions

**Modes:**
- **Track Mode**: Analyze individual track(s)

- "Quantize to 16th notes with 70% strength"

**Input**: Rhythm descriptions, style requests
**Output**: MIDI patterns (drum sequences), quantization settings, groove templates

**Coordination**: Works with DAW Agent to place MIDI, with Performance Agent for feel

---

### 11. **Structure Agent** 📐
**Purpose**: Song arrangement, section placement, form
**Knows**: Song forms (verse-chorus, ABAB, etc.), section types, arrangement patterns
**Generates**: Structure markers and arrangement suggestions

**Use Cases:**
- "Arrange this as verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus"
- "Double the chorus at the end"
- "Add an 8-bar intro before the verse"
- "Repeat the bridge twice"
- "Fade out the last 4 bars"

**Input**: Structure requests, existing sections
**Output**: Section markers, arrangement instructions

**Coordination**: Works with DAW Agent to place markers, with Automation Agent for transitions

---

### 12. **Harmony Agent** 🎼
**Purpose**: Chord progressions, voice leading, harmonic analysis
**Knows**: Harmony theory, voice leading rules, chord functions, substitutions
**Generates**: Chord progressions with proper voice leading

**Use Cases:**
- "Create a jazz progression with smooth voice leading"
- "Add chord extensions to this progression"
- "Substitute dominant chords for more color"
- "Create a modal progression in Dorian"
- "Analyze the harmony of track 1"

**Note**: Might overlap with Arranger Agent - could be a specialized subset

## Agent Priority Ranking

### High Priority (Most Useful)
1. **Mix/Analysis Agent** - Critical for production quality (unified mixing/mastering/analysis)
2. **Sound Design Agent** - Essential for electronic music
3. **Performance Agent** - Makes MIDI sound more musical

### Medium Priority
5. **Rhythm Agent** - Useful for drum programming
6. **Structure Agent** - Helps with arrangement

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)
7. **Harmony Agent** - Overlaps with Arranger Agent
8. **Lyrics/Vocal Agent** - Only needed if working with vocals
9. **Sample/Asset Agent** - Depends on workflow
10. **Reference Agent** - Advanced mixing feature (could integrate with Mix/Analysis Agent)

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Simple Chain
```
User Request → DAW Agent → Actions
```

### Musical Content Chain
```
User Request → DAW Agent (with placeholder) → Arranger Agent → Inject Notes
```

### Complex Multi-Agent
```
User Request
  → Analysis Agent (detect key/tempo)
  → DAW Agent (create structure)
  → Arranger Agent (generate chords)
  → Sound Design Agent (configure synth)
  → Mix Agent (add FX)
  → Performance Agent (humanize)
  → Automation Agent (add dynamics)
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Agent Interface Standardization
All agents should follow a consistent pattern:
```go
type Agent interface {
    Generate(ctx context.Context, request AgentRequest) (*AgentResult, error)
}
```

### Placeholder System
Agents that need coordination should use placeholders:
- `<PLACEHOLDER_MUSICAL_CONTENT>` - Arranger Agent
- `<PLACEHOLDER_AUTOMATION_CURVE>` - Automation Agent
- `<PLACEHOLDER_FX_CHAIN>` - Mix Agent
- `<PLACEHOLDER_SYNTH_PARAMS>` - Sound Design Agent
- etc.

### Context Sharing
Agents may need to share context:
- Project state (BPM, time signature, key)
- Track information (what's on each track)
- Analysis results (frequency content, structure)

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize which agents to implement first (likely Mix Agent and Sound Design Agent)
2. Design agent interfaces and coordination patterns
3. Implement placeholder system for agent coordination
4. Build orchestrator to coordinate multiple agents
