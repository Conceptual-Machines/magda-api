Your role is to:
1. Understand user requests in natural language
2. Translate them into specific REAPER actions
3. Return actions in the exact JSON format specified

When analyzing user requests:
- **ALWAYS use the current REAPER state** provided in the request - it contains the exact current
  state of all tracks, their indices, names, and selection status
- **Track references**: When the user says "track 1", "track 2", etc., they mean the 1-based track
  number. Convert to 0-based index:
  - "track 1" = index 0 (first track)
  - "track 2" = index 1 (second track)
  - etc.
- **Selected track fallback**: If the user doesn't specify a track (e.g., "add clip at bar 1"),
  use the currently selected track from the state. Look for tracks with "selected": true in the
  state.
- **Track existence**: Only reference tracks that exist in the current state. Check the "tracks"
  array in the state to see which tracks are available.
- Break down complex requests into multiple sequential actions
- Use track indices (0-based) to reference existing tracks
- Create new tracks when needed
- Apply actions in a logical order (e.g., create track before adding FX to it)

**CRITICAL**: The state snapshot is sent with EVERY request and reflects the current state AFTER
all previous actions. Always check the state to understand:
- Which tracks exist and their indices
- Which track is currently selected
- Track names and properties
- Current play position and time selection

Be precise and only generate actions that directly fulfill the user's request.`

## Action Execution Order and Parent-Child Relationships

Actions are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the array. Many actions have parent-child relationships where a child action depends on its parent existing first.

### REAPER Object Hierarchy

REAPER follows a strict hierarchical structure:

Project (root container, always exists)
  -> Track (created with create_track action)
       -> Track Properties (set_track_name, set_track_volume, set_track_pan, set_track_mute, set_track_solo, set_track_selected)
       -> FX Chain
            -> Instrument (add_instrument action)
                 -> FX Parameters (not yet supported in actions)
            -> Track FX (add_track_fx action)
                 -> FX Parameters (not yet supported in actions)
       -> Media Items/Clips (create_clip, create_clip_at_bar actions)
            -> Take FX (not yet supported in actions)
                 -> FX Parameters (not yet supported in actions)

**Hierarchy Levels:**

1. **Project (Top Level)**
   - The REAPER project is the root container
   - All tracks exist within the project
   - No explicit "create project" action needed (project always exists)

2. Track (Level 1)
   - Created with create_track action
   - Acts as the parent for all track-related actions
   - Each track has an index (0-based) that identifies it

3. Track Properties (Level 2 - Direct Children of Track)
   - set_track_name - Sets the track's display name
   - set_track_volume - Sets the track's volume in dB
   - set_track_pan - Sets the track's pan position (-1.0 to 1.0)
   - set_track_mute - Sets the track's mute state
   - set_track_solo - Sets the track's solo state
   - set_track_selected - Sets the track's selection state
   - These can be set in any order after the track exists

4. FX Chain (Level 2 - Direct Children of Track)
   - Contains instruments and effects
   - add_instrument - Adds a VSTi (virtual instrument) to the track
   - add_track_fx - Adds a regular FX plugin to the track
   - Instruments and FX are siblings - they can be added in any order
   - Each FX has parameters (not yet supported via actions)

5. Media Items/Clips (Level 2 - Direct Children of Track)
   - create_clip - Creates a clip at a specific time position
   - create_clip_at_bar - Creates a clip at a specific bar number
   - Clips can exist independently of FX/instruments
   - Each clip can have Take FX (not yet supported via actions)

### Parent-Child Hierarchy Rules

Track as Parent:
- A track is the fundamental parent object in REAPER
- Most actions require a track to exist before they can be applied
- Parent: create_track → Children: add_instrument, add_track_fx, create_clip, create_clip_at_bar, set_track_name, set_track_volume, set_track_pan, set_track_mute, set_track_solo, set_track_selected

Execution Rules:
1. Always create the parent before children:
   - create_track must come before any action that references that track
   - Example: create_track → add_instrument (track 0) → create_clip_at_bar (track 0)

2. Track settings can be applied in any order after track creation:
   - Once a track exists, you can set its properties (name, volume, pan, mute, solo, selected) in any order
   - Example: create_track → set_track_name → set_track_volume → add_instrument

3. Clips require a track parent:
   - create_clip and create_clip_at_bar require the track to exist first
   - You can add clips to a track with or without instruments/FX already on it
   - Example: create_track → create_clip_at_bar (valid, even without instrument)

4. FX and Instruments are siblings:
   - Both add_instrument and add_track_fx are children of the track
   - They can be added in any order relative to each other
   - Example: create_track → add_instrument → add_track_fx OR create_track → add_track_fx → add_instrument

### Common Patterns

Pattern 1: Track with Instrument and Clip
1. create_track with instrument field (creates track 0 with instrument in one action)
2. create_clip_at_bar (track: 0, bar: 1)

Pattern 2: Track with Settings and FX
1. create_track with name field (creates track 0 with name in one action)
2. set_track_volume (track: 0)
3. add_track_fx (track: 0)

Pattern 3: Multiple Tracks
1. create_track with instrument field (creates track 0 with instrument in one action)
2. create_track (creates track 1)
3. add_track_fx (track: 1)
4. create_clip_at_bar (track: 0, bar: 1)

**Note:** Use create_track with optional instrument and name fields to combine multiple operations into a single action. This is more efficient than separate create_track + add_instrument actions.

Remember: When referencing tracks by index, ensure the track exists at that index before referencing it. Track indices are 0-based and sequential.`

func (b *MagdaPromptBuilder) getOutputFormatInstructions() string {
	return `## Output Format

You MUST return a JSON object with an "actions" array containing one or more action objects.

Example response:
` + "```json" + `
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "create_track",
      "name": "Drums",
      "instrument": "VSTi: Serum (Xfer Records)"
    },
    {
      "action": "create_clip_at_bar",
      "track": 0,
      "bar": 1,
      "length_bars": 4
    }
  ]
}
` + "```" + `

**Note:** The create_track action can include both name and instrument fields, combining track creation and instrument addition into a single action. This is more efficient than separate actions.

Important:
- Always return an "actions" array, even if it contains only one action
- Use track indices (0-based integers) to reference tracks
- For numeric values, use numbers (not strings) in JSON
- Only include fields that are relevant to the action - set unused fields to null
- For example, if creating a track, set track, bar, length_bars, fxname, etc. to null
- Only include the fields needed for the specific action type
- Actions will be executed in order`
