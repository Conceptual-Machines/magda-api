# CHORD PROGRESSION GENERATION - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE

## OVERVIEW
When generating chord progressions, your goal is to create musically interesting, harmonically rich sequences that avoid clichés and demonstrate sophisticated harmonic thinking.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. HARMONIC STRUCTURE
- Generate HARMONIC material (multiple simultaneous notes forming chords)
- Create rich, full-sounding chords with proper harmony
- Use chord extensions (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths) to add color and interest
- Ensure chords sound at the same startBeats value (simultaneous notes)
- Use proper voice leading between chords for smooth transitions

### 2. HARMONIC VARIETY & SOPHISTICATION

**COMMON PATTERNS TO USE SPARINGLY:**
- I-IV-V, I-V-vi-IV, I-vi-IV-V are valid but overused
- Don't default to these patterns automatically
- They work fine but explore other options too
- Progressions using ONLY I, IV, V, vi lack variety

**EXPAND YOUR HARMONIC PALETTE:**
- ii chords (supertonic) - creates gentle stepwise motion
- iii chords (mediant) - adds color and unexpected movement
- vii° chords (leading tone diminished) - creates tension
- Extended chords (maj7, min7, dom7, 9ths, etc.)
- Modal interchange (borrowing from parallel modes)
- Secondary dominants (V/ii, V/iii, V/vi, etc.)
- Circle of fifths progressions (I-IV-vii°-iii-vi-ii-V-I)
- Chromatic mediants (bVI, bIII, III)

**BALANCE:**
- Familiar progressions (I-IV-V) are fine when appropriate
- But also explore the full harmonic palette available
- Mix common and less common chord movements
- The goal is musical interest, not just avoiding patterns

### 3. HARMONIC SOPHISTICATION

**GOOD HARMONIC CHOICES:**
- I-ii-iii-IV (stepwise motion)
- vi-IV-ii-V (circle of fifths fragment)
- I-bVII-IV-I (modal interchange)
- Imaj7-iii7-vi7-ii7-V7 (jazz turnaround)
- I-V/vi-vi-IV (secondary dominant)
- I-bVI-bVII-I (chromatic mediants)
- ii-V-I (strongest resolution in music)

**VOICE LEADING:**
- Move notes by the smallest possible interval between chords
- Aim for smooth, connected motion (not random jumps)
- Keep common tones between chords when possible
- If one voice moves up, another can move down for balance

### 4. HARMONIC RHYTHM
**Harmonic rhythm** = how often chords change

**Options:**
- **Every 4 beats (1 chord per bar):** Traditional, spacious, allows breathing room
- **Every 2 beats (2 chords per bar):** Moderate movement, common in pop/rock
- **Every beat:** Fast harmonic rhythm, creates urgency and momentum
- **Mixed rhythm:** Vary the pace - some chords sustain longer, others change quickly

**CRITICAL:** Once you establish a harmonic rhythm, maintain consistency unless there's a musical reason to change it.

### 5. CHORD EXTENSIONS AND COLOR TONES

**Basic Triads (3 notes):**
- Major: Root, 3rd, 5th (C-E-G)
- Minor: Root, b3rd, 5th (C-Eb-G)
- Diminished: Root, b3rd, b5th (C-Eb-Gb)

**Extended Chords (4+ notes) - PREFERRED:**
- Maj7: Root, 3rd, 5th, 7th (C-E-G-B) - bright, jazzy
- Min7: Root, b3rd, 5th, b7th (C-Eb-G-Bb) - smooth, mellow
- Dom7: Root, 3rd, 5th, b7th (C-E-G-Bb) - wants to resolve
- Min7b5: Root, b3rd, b5th, b7th (C-Eb-Gb-Bb) - dark, tense
- 9th chords: Add the 9th (2nd octave up) for extra color
- 13th chords: Full jazz voicing with 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th

**USE EXTENSIONS LIBERALLY** - they make progressions sound more sophisticated and less generic.

### 6. NOVELTY PARAMETER

**Low Novelty (Conservative):**
- Stick to diatonic chords (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii°)
- Use mostly triads or simple 7th chords
- Predictable, safe progressions
- Example: Imaj7-vi7-ii7-V7 in C major

**Medium Novelty (Recommended Default):**
- Diatonic + modal interchange
- Secondary dominants
- Extended harmonies (9ths, some 11ths)
- Example: Imaj7-bVII7-vi7-V/vi-ii7-V7 in C major

**High Novelty (Adventurous):**
- Chromatic mediants
- Tritone substitutions
- Altered dominants (b9, #9, #11, b13)
- Parallel major/minor movement
- Example: Imaj7-bVI7-bII7-V7alt-Imaj7 in C major

### 7. DURATION AND COMPLETENESS

**NEVER leave bars empty** - fill the entire requested duration with chords

**Duration Calculation:**
- 1 bar = 4 beats (in 4/4 time)
- 4 bars = 16 beats total
- If user requests "4-bar progression", generate notes from beat 0 to beat 16

**Example - 4 bars, 1 chord per bar:**
- Chord 1: beats 0-4
- Chord 2: beats 4-8
- Chord 3: beats 8-12
- Chord 4: beats 12-16

### 8. AVOIDING REPETITION

**CRITICAL:** Do not repeat the same chord pattern over and over.

**Bad (repetitive):**
- I-IV-V-I, I-IV-V-I, I-IV-V-I, I-IV-V-I (same pattern 4 times)

**Good (varied):**
- I-vi-ii-V, iii-vi-ii-V, IV-vii°-iii-vi, ii-V-I (different each time)

**Development techniques:**
- Start simple, add complexity
- Use sequences (repeat a pattern at different pitch levels)
- Create question-answer phrases (tension → resolution)
- Build to a climax and resolve

## PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Sophisticated 8-bar progression in C major (medium novelty)
```
Bar 1 (0-4):   Cmaj7  (C-E-G-B)
Bar 2 (4-8):   Am7    (A-C-E-G)
Bar 3 (8-12):  Dm7    (D-F-A-C)
Bar 4 (12-16): G7     (G-B-D-F)
Bar 5 (16-20): Em7    (E-G-B-D)
Bar 6 (20-24): A7     (A-C#-E-G) - secondary dominant (V/ii)
Bar 7 (24-28): Dm7    (D-F-A-C)
Bar 8 (28-32): G7     (G-B-D-F)
```
**Why this works:** Uses ii, iii, vi, not just I-IV-V-vi. Includes secondary dominant (A7). Voice leading flows smoothly.

### Example 2: High novelty progression in D minor
```
Bar 1 (0-4):   Dm9     (D-F-A-C-E)
Bar 2 (4-8):   Bbmaj7  (Bb-D-F-A) - bVI, modal interchange
Bar 3 (8-12):  Ebmaj7#11 (Eb-G-Bb-D-F#) - bII, chromatic mediant
Bar 4 (12-16): A7alt   (A-C#-E-G-Bb-Db) - altered dominant
```
**Why this works:** Extended chords, chromatic harmony, unexpected but musical movement, jazz-influenced.

### Example 3: Circle of fifths movement in G major
```
Bar 1-2 (0-8):   Gmaj7  (G-B-D-F#)
Bar 3-4 (8-16):  Cmaj7  (C-E-G-B)
Bar 5-6 (16-24): F#m7b5 (F#-A-C-E)
Bar 7-8 (24-32): Bm7    (B-D-F#-A)
```
**Why this works:** Descending fifths (G→C→F#→B), strong harmonic motion, uses vii and iii.

### Example 4: Replaying chords with rhythm variations (like a keyboard player)
**When user requests "replay", "retrigger", or wants chords played with rhythm:**
- **CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT SAME chords from the original progression
- Play each chord multiple times at different beats (syncopation)
- Mix in arpeggios of the same chord tones
- Vary the rhythm but keep the harmonic content identical

**Example - Replaying a C major chord with rhythm variations:**
```
Original: C major chord at beat 0 (C-E-G, duration 4 beats)

Replayed version:
Beat 0.0:   C-E-G (full chord, simultaneous)
Beat 0.5:   C-E-G (quick retrigger)
Beat 1.5:   C-E-G-C (arpeggio up, then chord)
Beat 2.5:   C-E-G (syncopated hit)
Beat 3.0:   E-G-C (arpeggio down)
Beat 3.5:   C-E-G (final hit)
```

**Key principles for replaying chords:**
1. **Preserve chord identity**: If original has C major (C-E-G), all retriggers must use C-E-G (not C-E-G-B or other variants)
2. **Syncopation**: Play chords at off-beats (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 beats) not just strong beats (0, 1, 2, 3)
3. **Retriggering**: Same chord played multiple times within a bar (not sustained pads)
4. **Arpeggios mixed in**: Break up the chord into sequential notes (C-E-G-C or G-E-C-G) but use ONLY notes from the original chord
5. **Rhythm variety**: Mix full chords (simultaneous notes) with arpeggios (sequential notes) of the same chord

**Example - Replaying a 4-bar progression (C-Am-F-G):**
```
Original progression:
Beat 0-4:   C major (C-E-G)
Beat 4-8:   Am (A-C-E)
Beat 8-12:  F major (F-A-C)
Beat 12-16: G major (G-B-D)

Replayed version with rhythm:
Beat 0.0:   C-E-G (full chord)
Beat 0.5:   C-E-G (retrigger)
Beat 1.5:   C-E-G-C (arpeggio)
Beat 2.5:   C-E-G (syncopated)
Beat 3.0:   E-G-C (arpeggio)
Beat 4.0:   A-C-E (full chord - Am)
Beat 4.5:   A-C-E (retrigger)
Beat 5.5:   A-C-E-A (arpeggio)
Beat 6.5:   A-C-E (syncopated)
Beat 7.0:   C-E-A (arpeggio)
Beat 8.0:   F-A-C (full chord - F major)
Beat 8.5:   F-A-C (retrigger)
Beat 9.5:   F-A-C-F (arpeggio)
Beat 10.5:  F-A-C (syncopated)
Beat 11.0:  A-C-F (arpeggio)
Beat 12.0:  G-B-D (full chord - G major)
Beat 12.5:  G-B-D (retrigger)
Beat 13.5:  G-B-D-G (arpeggio)
Beat 14.5:  G-B-D (syncopated)
Beat 15.0:  B-D-G (arpeggio)
```

**CRITICAL - What NOT to do:**
- ❌ **DON'T** create new chords or change the harmony
- ❌ **DON'T** only play chords at beats 0, 4, 8, 12 (that's the original pattern)
- ❌ **DON'T** generate arpeggios that don't match the original chord tones
- ❌ **DON'T** create completely new arpeggio patterns unrelated to the chords

**CRITICAL - What TO do:**
- ✅ **DO** use the exact same chord tones from the original
- ✅ **DO** play chords at syncopated beats (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5)
- ✅ **DO** mix full chords with arpeggios of the same chord
- ✅ **DO** create rhythmic interest while preserving harmonic content
- ✅ **DO** think like a keyboard player: retriggering chords, adding subtle arpeggios, syncopated hits

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before finalizing a chord progression, verify:
- ✅ Shows harmonic variety and interest
- ✅ Includes chord extensions when appropriate (7ths, 9ths)
- ✅ Doesn't rely exclusively on I-IV-V-vi
- ✅ Has smooth voice leading between chords
- ✅ Fills the entire requested duration (no empty bars)
- ✅ Demonstrates thoughtful chord choices, not random selection
- ✅ Creates a sense of musical direction (tension and resolution)
- ✅ Balances familiarity with exploration

## REMEMBER

Create progressions that are musically compelling and interesting, using the full harmonic palette available. Common progressions like I-IV-V are fine when appropriate, but explore other possibilities too. The goal is musical quality and interest, not rigidly avoiding certain patterns.
