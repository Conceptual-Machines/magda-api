**ADVANCED HARMONIC THEORY — REVISED GUIDELINES**

**GENERAL PRINCIPLES**
- Treat harmony as a flow of *function and color*, not a rigid system.
- Voice-lead smoothly; retain common tones between chords.
- Prefer **tension–release phrasing** across 4–8 beat arcs.
- Always contextualize harmony within mood, style, and rhythm.

---

**HARMONIC MOTION**
- Use **functional motion** (Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic) as the baseline.
- Insert **secondary dominants** and **modal interchange** for tension and surprise.
- Resolve leading tones with intent—either **conventionally (V→I)** or **deceptively (V→vi, V→♭VI)**.
- For longer phrases:
  - *4 bars:* establish key
  - *8 bars:* reach peak tension at bar 6–7, release by bar 8
  - *16 bars:* mid-point modulation or modal color change

---

**CHORD EXTENSIONS & COLOR**
- 7ths, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths add emotion—use to shape the tension curve:
  - 7th = mild tension
  - 9th/11th = moderate tension
  - 13th or altered (♭9, ♯11) = strong tension
- Drop extensions gradually during release or cadence.
- In sparse textures, emphasize 3rd + 7th for function clarity.

**MODAL & TONAL NUANCE**
| Mode | Core Character | Harmonic Tendency | Example Usage |
|------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Ionian | stable, bright | avoid ♭7 | pop, folk |
| Dorian | soulful, ambiguous | favor ii–IV or I–VII | funk, neo-soul |
| Phrygian | tense, dark | use ♭2 (avoid 4–5 motion) | cinematic, metal |
| Lydian | ethereal, open | emphasize ♯4 | film, fusion |
| Mixolydian | bluesy, relaxed | use ♭VII, avoid leading tone | rock, groove |
| Aeolian | melancholic | ii°–V deceptive | ballad, soundtrack |
| Locrian | unstable | use for color, not tonic | jazz tension inserts |

---

**MODAL INTERCHANGE (BORROWED CHORDS)**
- Borrow from **parallel minor/major** to alter color:
  - I → i
  - IV → iv
  - V → ♭VII
  - ii → ii°
- Use borrowed chords to shift emotional direction mid-phrase (hope → nostalgia, etc.).
- Borrow *sparingly*—one borrowed chord per 4–8 beats keeps clarity.

**GENRE MAPPINGS**
| Style | Typical Harmony | Recommended Devices |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Pop | diatonic, simple IV–V–I | add secondary dominant or ♭VII |
| Jazz | extended chords, ii–V–I | tritone subs, modal interchange |
| R&B | rich color, modal mixture | IVmaj7–iii7–vi7 loops |
| EDM | static, modal | pedal bass + color chords |
| Cinematic | evolving, chromatic | mediant moves, non-functional modulations |
| Rock | Mixolydian, power chords | use ♭VII and IV–I cadences |
| Classical | strict functional | tonic–dominant polarity, modulation to V or relative minor |

---

**TENSION–RELEASE DESIGN**
- Plan harmonic energy intentionally:
  - *Low tension:* diatonic triads, perfect intervals, smooth voice leading.
  - *Medium tension:* added 7ths/9ths, secondary dominants.
  - *High tension:* chromatic mediants, altered dominants, tritone substitutions.
- Always **release tension** with resolution, silence, or return to stable chord tones.
- The best sequences *breathe* — avoid constant intensity.

---

**MELODIC-HARMONIC CONNECTION**
- Emphasize chord tones on downbeats.
- Use non-chord tones (passing, neighbor, suspension) for melodic movement but **resolve by step**.
- Maintain pitch-center gravity (resolve to 1, 3, or 5 of the tonic key).

---

**PHRASING & CADENCE**
- Cadences every 4, 8, or 16 beats.
- Choose cadences by mood:
  - Perfect (V–I): closure
  - Plagal (IV–I): warmth
  - Deceptive (V–vi): surprise
  - Half (…–V): suspension
- For open-ended styles, replace cadences with pedal points or sustained tensions.
