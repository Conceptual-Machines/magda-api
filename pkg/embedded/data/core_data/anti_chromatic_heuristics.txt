**ANTI-CHROMATIC HEURISTICS — REVISED GUIDELINES**

**PURPOSE**
Maintain melodic clarity and tonal focus by avoiding aimless chromatic motion. Use chromaticism *expressively*, not habitually.

---

**CORE PRINCIPLES**
- Avoid continuous chromatic or scalar motion without harmonic intent.
- Focus on **chord tones** (1, 3, 5, 7) and **diatonic passing tones**.
- Limit consecutive semitone movements to a **maximum of two**; break with leaps or skips.
- Prefer **melodic intervals of 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths** for structural clarity.
- Align phrase starts, cadences, and harmonic changes with **phrase boundaries (4–8 beats)**.

---

**ALLOWED CHROMATIC USES (CONTEXTUAL EXCEPTIONS)**
- **Approach tones** leading by semitone into a chord tone (ascending or descending).
- **Enclosures**: e.g., upper-lower approach around a target note (jazz phrasing).
- **Chromatic passing tones** in stepwise motion between diatonic tones, provided:
  - They resolve immediately.
  - They do not repeat or form continuous runs.
- **Borrowed scale notes** from parallel modes (♭6 in major, ♯4 in minor) are permitted when harmonically grounded.
- **Blues chromaticism** (flat 5 or mixolydian ♭3–3 oscillation) is acceptable if stylistically appropriate.

---

**PHRASE & HARMONY INTEGRATION**
- Use leaps to emphasize **underlying harmony**.
- Anchor phrases on chord tones during harmonic changes.
- Chromatic notes should resolve by **step into diatonic tones**.
- Reserve chromatic movement for **transitions, fills, or expressive color**, not the main motif.
- Keep tension brief—typically within a single beat or half-beat.

---

**MOTIVIC CONSISTENCY**
- Repeat and vary **motifs**, not chromatic runs.
- Develop motifs by rhythm, contour, or interval, not chromatic drift.
- Every chromatic note should feel **intentional**—never filler.

---

**GENRE CONTEXT RECOMMENDATIONS**
| Style | Chromatic Usage | Comment |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Classical | limited | only as passing or neighbor tones |
| Jazz | moderate | enclosures, approach tones, bebop chromaticism |
| Rock / Blues | expressive | ♭3–3 or ♭5–5 color tones allowed |
| EDM / Pop | minimal | keep melodic center strong |
| Cinematic | contextual | tension-building transitions only |
| Fusion / Prog | advanced | controlled chromatic sequences acceptable if harmonically justified |

---

**RHYTHMIC PLACEMENT OF CHROMATICISM**
- Place chromatic tones on **weak subdivisions** (off-beats, 16th upbeats).
- Resolve on strong beats with chord tones.
- For 4/4, preferred pattern: tension (beat 2 or 4) → resolution (beat 1 or 3).
- Never sustain chromatic tones longer than the beat unless forming a suspended tension that resolves harmonically.

---

**QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST**
-  No more than two consecutive semitones.
-  All chromatic tones resolve by step to chord tones.
-  No repeating chromatic runs longer than 4 notes.
-  Each chromatic choice serves melodic or emotional purpose.
-  Chromaticism aligns with harmonic context and phrase boundaries.

---

**SUMMARY**
Chromaticism should **amplify emotion or momentum**, not distract from tonality.
Use sparingly and intentionally to enrich melodic contour, highlight transitions, or express tension–release arcs.
